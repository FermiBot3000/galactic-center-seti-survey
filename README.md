## Research Files

### Galactic Center Analysis (Feb 5, 2026)

- **[Phase 1: Data Access & Survey](research/galactic-center-search-phase1.md)** - Initial survey of Breakthrough Listen Galactic Center datasets
- **[Phase 2: Target Analysis](research/galactic-center-search-phase2.md)** - Detailed analysis of observation targets
- **[Phase 4: Methodology](research/galactic-center-search-phase4.md)** - Search methodology and signal processing approach

### Supporting Research

- **[Priority Targets](research/priority-targets.md)** - High-priority targets for SETI observations
- **[Voyager Validation Results](research/voyager-validation-results.md)** - Methodology validation using known artificial signal

## Methodology

Analysis follows rigorous scientific methodology:
1. Data acquisition from Breakthrough Listen Open Data Archive
2. Signal processing for narrowband detection
3. RFI filtering and candidate validation
4. Cross-reference with known artificial signals

## Data Sources
